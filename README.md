# Employee-Exit-Survey

In this project, my goal is to analyze the employee satisfaction. I used two data sets which are obtained from [TAFE](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and [DETE](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).
I opened data and cleaned to prepare to analyze. I used pandas and numpy libraries in this process. I dropped null values or I changed their values to use effectively. Also, I categorized some columns to make it understandable. I made exploratory analysis. Finally I used matplotlib to visualize my results.

## Conclusion

I created a bar plot which shows the dissatisfied employee's rate. Especially, the "Estabilished" employees have highest dissatisfaction rate.
